### Plague Exodus

###### About
Plague exodus is a 2D side-scroller adventure RPG game made by a group of 3 within a period of 1 month.  The game begins with a prologue wherein the player is introduced how a plague swept over the lands and drove almost all life forms to extinction.  The character learns that there is a mythical cure that could save them from extinction and sets out to find it.  It is quite a long journey and with the destruction of the plague everything else that is left alive is hungry for anything that they come across.
